I really enjoy this course and I've been taking extensive notes. The notes I took after the midterm are more comprehensive and explanatory (because i had a bad midterm). I highly recommend reading Ethem Alpaydin's book, which is available in the shared drive, as it provides a good overview of machine learning concepts.
